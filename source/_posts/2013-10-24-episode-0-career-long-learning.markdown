In this inaugural episode Jeff talks about recommended reading for software craftsmen and programmers in general. The books are split into two groups: 1) essential reading list, and 2) the rest of the software craftsman's bookshelf. The most important part of this episode is a working definition, or, more accurately, an explanation of the term "software craftsman."
