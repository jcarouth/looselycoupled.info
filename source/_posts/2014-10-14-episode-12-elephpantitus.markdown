In this episode Jeff and Matt finally discover the mystery of the Trello card "Elephpantitus" and attempt to cover how important or how unimportant it is to diversify your programming background within a given language community. Perhaps it's a good idea to focus on being a PHP developer rather than a WordPress developer or a Magento developer, or maybe it isn't. This episode could be titled Maybe since they weren't really sure which way to lean starting out.
