In this episode Jeff and Matt discuss passion and confidence within the context of development and how to deal with internal and external influence on your passion. They cover caring about what you're doing, motivation level, dealing with criticism and feedback, Imposter Syndrome, and the Dunning-Kruger man. Key takeaways are to remember that everyone experiences highs and lows in their confidence; coping with what seems like a lack of passion can be as simple as doing something else for a while; and it is important to be aware of your situation and to talk about it.
