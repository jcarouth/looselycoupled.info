In this episode Matt and Jeff talk about how and why you should consider getting involved in side projects. Despite the jovial subtitle, "Getting a little side action," participating in development outside of your normal development routine is beneficial to you as a developer as well as to your employer or clients. They further expand on the topic by talking about non-code-related side projects such as podcasts, discussion groups, or even writing.

If you're looking for a project to get involved with, the [PHP Mentoring Mentor App](https://github.com/phpmentoring/mentor-app) would love to have your participation. Contact either of us, or come hang out in #phpmentoring on Freenode to get involved.
