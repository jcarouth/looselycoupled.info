In this episode Jeff and Matt talk about systems administration and DevOps for developers. This topic is important because, as developers, having an understanding of the full stack your application is deployed on can separate you as a senior developer. They talk about some times when having some insight into working with linux, managing and configuring webservers, databases, etc. has come in handy as well as reference some important things you should know as a developer to be able to help in an emergency or just to maintain your application's health in production.
