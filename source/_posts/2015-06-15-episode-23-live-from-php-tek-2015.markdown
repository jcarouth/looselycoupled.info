This is a live mashup episode with [PHP Roundtable](https://www.phproundtable.com/) from [php[tek] 2015](http://tek.phparch.com) where we are joined by [Sammy Kaye Powers](https://twitter.com/SammyK) from PHP Roundtable, [Jordi Boggiano](https://twitter.com/seldaek) from [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [Coderabbi](https://twitter.com/coderabbi), and a host of other people drifting in and out of the conversation from the audience. This was a special episode where we commemorate the success of [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) with an ice cream cake.
