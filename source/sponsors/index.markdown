Our sponsorship structure is focused around per-episode sponsorship. We aim to release a new episode every other week. We are open to mixing pre-recorded spots into our final production if you have them, or we are willing to write and include some information about you, what you do, and why our listeners should look into your company or organization.

Sponsorship also includes information in the publicized post about the episode which will show up on http://looselycoupled.info, is sent in our newsletter, and in syndication applications such at iTunes. We will also include information about your sponsorship in tweets leading up to the release of the episode(s) you sponsor. For longer-term commitments we will display your logo and brief information about you in the sidebar of our website.

The sponsorship rate is $150/episode. We prefer that you commit to a minimum of two episodes, so we offer a discount for sponsorship commitments in two- and six-episode blocks. We do want to establish solid, on-going relationships with our sponsors, so we want to know what you do and to be excited to include you in our show. __We are flexible with costs, especially if what you do is something we would really like to support__.

### Community Supporters

We also offer a community sponsorship level. This is reserved for projects, organizations, conferences, individual authors, podcasts, etc and will get you mention in our show as well as featured on our website as a community supporter. 

Cost of sponsorship at this level is __$50__.

If you have questions about your eligibility for this level please contact us at sponsors@looselycoupled.info.

## What your sponsorship dollars will do

We are always looking for ways to improve our show. We have some equipment needs to make recording more reliable both in our regular shows and our on-location shows we record at conferences and such. Some sponsorship money will go towards equipment upgrades.

We host the show website and the actual podcast episodes and some sponsorship dollars will go towards maintaining those resources.

Finally, we are proponents of giving back to the community. Our show is about improving developer's lives by talking about problems and situations we face in our careers. Part of that is the community. To date we have sponsored the LoneStarPHP Conference 2015 and the Wisdom as a Service Tour 2015 by Coderabbi. We hope to be able to give back more to the community and will use a portion of sponsorship funds to do that.
