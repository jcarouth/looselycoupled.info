The Loosely Coupled Podcast started as an experiment in distributing information about application architecture and development best practices. The first episode, [Episode 0](/blog/2013/10/24/episode-0-career-long-learning/) featured Jeff Carouth as the sole host. Shortly after that Jeff and Matt Frost connected and the Loosely Coupled you enjoy today was born.
