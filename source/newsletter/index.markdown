The Loosely Coupled Newsletter is your source to receive updates about released and upcoming episodes, stay informed about related events in the community, and have early and exclusive access to swag, orginal content, and relevant news. We can't promise that all of the content from our newsletters will be available to everyone else.

Don't worry we don't like being innudated with emails any more than you do, so we promise to keep it light and on a similar schedule to our episode releases.
